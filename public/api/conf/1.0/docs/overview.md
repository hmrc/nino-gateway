### NINO Insights

This API enables your application to get an opinion of the riskiness of a NINO.

Given a NINO, the response will provide:

* Risk score from 0 (no risk) to 100 (high risk)
* Reason providing an indication of why the risk score has been allocated
* Correlation Id - so you can reference the transaction in any feedback
